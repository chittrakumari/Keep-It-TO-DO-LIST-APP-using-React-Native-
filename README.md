# KeepIt

 KeepIt is a <b>TO DO LIST App built using React Native</b> where a user can add  new tasks and delete it too.

    The data of the app(i.e the tasks entered by the user) is stored  on  Firebase which is NOSQL Cloud based database 
    and we directly write and read the data from the database. After the read and write operations the state of the App 
    is going to be updated and maintained even after we refresh or close  our App.
